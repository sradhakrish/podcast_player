podcast_player
==============

This application is written using the BlackBerry 10 Native NDK, using C++ and QML.

To get the project running, first download and install the NDK, here : 
<html>developer.blackberry.com/native/downloads</html>

This runs on a version of Eclipse, so the IDE isn't terribly unfamiliar. To run the project, import the project as an existing BlackBerry Cascades project.
Import > BlackBerry > "Existing code as BlackBerry C/C++ Makefile project".

Version 1 (initial commit) only contains a very basic UI to run a hardcoded podcast URL.
